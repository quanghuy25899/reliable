Hello, I finished this web app in around 4 hours. I was used to use JavaScript frameworks like React or jQuery and style libraries
like AntDesign or Bulma, so it took me a while to build everything from scratch with just plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If I could use 
React and AntDesign I think I could finish it in around 2 hours. I feel more confident handling state in React.
